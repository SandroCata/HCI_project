1)	I use an app that sets a budget and records my daily expenses.
2)	I would like some features to keep track of debts and credits, categorize different kinds of expenses and the ability to manage multiple accounts.
3)	Yes, it would encourage me. It would help me realize that I am capable of reaching a set goal.
4)	Honestly, I don't know. I can't think of anything I would like to improve.

RAUL
1)	Yes. Personally, I like moving all my money from the debit card to a savings account and only withdraw money when I really need to. The savings account allows me to keep track of every transaction that I make easily by simply ensuring a self-imposed money limit for every week.
2)	I like it when there is an easy way to keep track of monthly expenses. For example a pie chart showing transactions by category (e.g. groceries, subscriptions, entertainment, bills).
3)	Yes, a reward system would motivate me to save up more. For example a fixed interest on the amount of money one has in the savings account where each month the accumulated interest gets added to the overall balance.
4)	I would definitely improve the ease of use of the application. Many times, simple tasks are so overcomplicated and hard to understand for the average user.

NICHOLAS
