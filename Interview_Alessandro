LUDOVICA:

1) yes, since I started working (babysitter, waitress, etc.) 
I have always written down my expenses and income on Excel. 
Since New Year's Eve I have been writing them down on an app

2)
- lots of graphs to know how I am spending/earning money;
- possibility of making estimates (like if I earn so much per month and spend so much, how much money will I have in month x?)
- ⁠advice on how to invest money

3) Maybe yes. If you won money or material things, maybe yes, but if they were just badges/insignias like those in games, probably not. 
However, to save money, it takes commitment and also the possibility of being able to do it (you can't avoid some expenses).

4) the possibility of "moving" money without it appearing in the graphs or lists of movements. 
For example, I have written down two accounts: the one in the bank and the paper money (to understand well where I have the money).  
If I withdraw €10 from the bank, I don't want to have to mark -€10 from the bank account and +€10 on the cash account. 
Then they would appear in the graphs. This messes up all the accounts

GABRIELE:

1) No, i don't adopt any particular strategy to save my money.

2) A very useful feature is the option to create separate balances for different payments.

3) Yes, i think a reward system could help me by giving me a little reward every time i save an amount of money.

4) One thing i would improve is the balance management through the possibility of marking the money i spend in more precise categories.
